# CareConnect – Nonprofit Organization FAQ Assistant

CareConnect is an AI-powered FAQ assistant designed to help nonprofit organizations communicate essential information clearly and efficiently to volunteers, donors, and beneficiaries.
Nonprofits often struggle with repeatedly answering common questions about their mission, donations, volunteering, and operations. CareConnect simplifies this by providing instant, accurate, and accessible responses through a conversational interface.

- Instantly answers common nonprofit-related questions  
- Improves accessibility to mission, donation, and volunteering information  
- Reduces the manual effort required by nonprofit staff  

The system is designed to be simple, reliable, and easy to use.

## Key Features

- Instant responses to frequently asked questions

- Context-aware and domain-specific answers  
- Clean, minimal, and user-friendly interface  
- Built with empathy and accessibility in mind  

## Tech Stack
